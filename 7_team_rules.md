# X-Team 07 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

If a team member has a preference for a specific task, they can be responsible for that task. However, if no one has a preference or if the rest of the team has no specific preference for what task they want to complete, we will split the tasks among group members accordingly (evenly split the amount of work). 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will communicate using iMessage and have at least one face-to-face meeting before the deadline. 


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will discuss it using iMessage and see if other people have better idea. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will text each other.
