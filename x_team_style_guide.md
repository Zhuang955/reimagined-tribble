# X-Team 07 Style Guide

Our team philosophy for style is that we will all follow the rules that we have decided on below and actively make sure that other team members are also following the rules as described at all times.  

## Naming conventions

We will use camel casing for the names of our variables, methods, and other potential names. 

### Examples
* interfaces
* classes
* exception types
* fields
* methods
* parameters
* local variables
* instance constants
* class constants

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

<brief statement of your team's commenting style>

### Examples

* classes
* fields
* constructors
* methods
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements
  * switch statement
  * while loops
  * for loops
  * enhanced for loops
