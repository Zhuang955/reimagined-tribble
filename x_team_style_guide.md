# X-Team 07 Style Guide

Our team philosophy for style is that we will all follow the rules that we have decided on below and actively make sure that other team members are also following the rules as described at all times.  

## Naming conventions

We will use camel casing for the names of our variables, methods, and other potential names. 

### Examples
* interfaces (We will use camel casing for this)
* classes (We will use camel casing for this)
* exception types (We will use camel casing for this)
* fields (We will use camel casing for this)
* methods (We will use camel casing for this)
* parameters (We will use camel casing for this)
* local variables (We will use camel casing for this)
* instance constants (We will use camel casing for this)
* class constants (We will use camel casing for this)

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:
